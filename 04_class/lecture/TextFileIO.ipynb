    "# Text File IO\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will learn how to read and write text to a file in C++. We will cover the basics of file streams, including how to open and close files, how to write data to a file using the `<<` operator, and how to read data from a file using the `getline()` function. We will also explore different file modes, such as write mode, append mode, and read mode, and how they can be used to perform different types of operations on a text file. By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of how to work with text files in C++ and be able to create your own applications that read and write data to files."
